            <h3>Welcome to my site.......
                I am Sumi Chanda, Student of Computer Science and Engineering at the Daffodil International University.

                I am a energetic, ambitious and hardworking individual, who always strives to achieve the highest
                standard
                possible, at any given task. I am friendly, helpful and polite, and have a good sense of humor.

                Cumilla is my hometown. It is one of the most ancient city which is famous for its natural beauty. Its
                called the town of bank and tank as so many banks and large sized ponds available here.

                I think cooking is a hidden talent in me. Creativity in cooking for me is presentation of food in its
                simplest form and garnishing it. </h3>

            <h2>Future Plan</h2>
            <h3>Become a Web Developer</h3>
            <p>My short term goal is first I want to work in a reputable Computer Science & Engineering related
                organization.

                But my dream is to be a good web designer and I want to start my "Website Development Company". Because
                I want to be an entrepreneur. At present the unemployment rate is increasing in our country. So, I want
                to reduce some unemployment and move the country towards digitalization. I want to represent my country
                in the world.</p>

                <h1>Fun Fact</h1>
                <p>If there is one thing that will not make me stressed, its cooking. I love just going over to the
                    stove
                    and making something that not only will take my stress away, but eat some delicious food as well.

                    Hearing the words â€˜this is amazingâ€™ was a huge motivator for me to keep spending time in the kitchen
                    when I was learning to cook.

                    The satisfaction of having something that you just made with your own two hands, and then the
                    compliments from other. Nothing beats that.

                    I am not formally trained nor a chef. But, Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m the best cook (after my mother of course ðŸ˜Š)
                    in
                    my own family. I have learned to fully enjoy the process of preparing a meal for my family. I find
                    great
                    joy in itâ€”far more than ever before. </p>
