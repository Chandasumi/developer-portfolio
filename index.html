            <h1>SUMI CHANDA</h1>
            <h3>Welcome to my site.......
                I am Sumi Chanda, Student of Computer Science and Engineering at the Daffodil International University.

                I am a energetic, ambitious and hardworking individual, who always strives to achieve the highest
                standard
                possible, at any given task. I am friendly, helpful and polite, and have a good sense of humor.

                Cumilla is my hometown. It is one of the most ancient city which is famous for its natural beauty. Its
                called the town of bank and tank as so many banks and large sized ponds available here.

                I think cooking is a hidden talent in me. Creativity in cooking for me is presentation of food in its
                simplest form and garnishing it. </h3>
